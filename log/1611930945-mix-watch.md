# Issue running mix watch

09:23:49.346 [error] Can't find executable `mac_listener`
09:23:49.347 [warn]  Could not start the file system monitor.'

Upgrading mix watch resolved the issue.

IMPORTANT: delete the _build directory for a clean build. I had some weird issues
perhaps with the some headers.
