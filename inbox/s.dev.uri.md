### URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

A URI is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. It is a general term that encompasses both URLs and URNs (Uniform Resource Names). A URI can be classified into:

1. **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: Identifies the resource by its location. It provides a means to access the resource by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network location). 
   `https://www.example.com:80/path/to/resource?query=123#fragment`
2. **URN (Uniform Resource Name)**: Identifies the resource by name within a given namespace. It is persistent and remains the same even if the resource's location changes.
   `urn:isbn:0451450523`
