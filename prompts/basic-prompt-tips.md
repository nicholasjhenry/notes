1. **Who**: Tell the agent about yourself if it's relevant (I'm a marketing manager working on a campaign)
2. **What**: Be specific about your task (I need to write a blog post about sustainable fashion)
3. **Why**: Share your goals (This needs to appeal to Gen Z customers)
4. **How**: Mention any preferences (Keep it under 500 words and include statistics)

## Enhanced

1. Ask the agent to think out loud: When you need help with something complex, try: "Think through this step-by-step" or "Break this down into smaller steps."
2. Be specific when results are too vague: If the agent's response isn't quite what you need, add more detail: "That's helpful, but I need ideas specifically for a family vacation with teenagers, not young children."
3. Refine through conversation: Treat the agent as your creative partner and shape the output together: "I like where this email draft is going, could you make it more casual and half as long?"
4. Specify your audience and tone: "Explain investing to a teenager" will get very different results than just "Explain investing."
