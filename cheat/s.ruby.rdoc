Style guide based on Rails documention

    module Namespace #:nodoc: don't document this

      # Generic Namespace exception class
      class NamespaceError < StandardError
      end

      # Raised when...
      class SpecificError < NamespaceError
      end

      # Document the responsibility of the class
      #
      # == Heading
      #
      # Use headings to break up descriptions
      #
      # == Formatting
      #
      # Embody +parameters+ or +options+ in Teletype Text tags. You can also use
      # *bold* or *italics* but must use HTML tags for <b>multiple words</b>,
      # <i>like this</i> and <tt>like this</tt>.
      class Base

        # RDOC documents constants as well
        MAX_NUMBER_OF_BOOKINGS = 3

        # Write comments above for accessors, this will be presented as [R/W]
        attr_accessor :first_name

        # However this one will be presented as [R]
        attr_reader :name

        def initialize(string) #:notnew: stops RDoc from seeing the initialize method as the new method

        end

        # Desribe the behaviour of the method
        #
        # ==== Attributes
        #
        # * +remove_string+ - Document the first attribute
        # * +append_string+ - Document the second attribute
        # * +options+ - Document the third attribute
        #
        # ==== Options
        #
        # You may which to break out options as a separate item since there maybe
        # multiple items. Note options are prefixed with a colon, denoting them
        # as a
        #
        # * +:conditions+ - An SQL fragment like "administrator = 1"
        # * +:order+ - An SQL fragment like "created_at DESC, name".
        # * +:group+ - An attribute name by which the result should be grouped
        # * +:limit+ - An integer determining the limit on the number of rows that should be returned.
        # * +:offset+ - An integer determining the offset from where the rows should be fetched.
        # * +:joins+ - Either an SQL fragment for additional joins like "LEFT JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = id" (rarely needed)
        #
        # ==== Examples
        #
        # Illustrate the behaviour of the method using examples. Indent examples:
        #
        #    base = Base.new("Example String")
        #    base.method_name("Example", "more")
        def method_name(remove_string, append_string, options)

Examples from Active Record

    module ActiveRecord #:nodoc:
      # Generic Active Record exception class.
      class ActiveRecordError < StandardError
      end

      # Raised when the single-table inheritance mechanism failes to locate the subclass
      # (for example due to improper usage of column that +inheritance_column+ points to).
      class SubclassNotFound < ActiveRecordError #:nodoc:
      end

      class Base

        # A generic "counter updater" implementation, intended primarily to be
        # used by increment_counter and decrement_counter, but which may also
        # be useful on its own. It simply does a direct SQL update for the record
        # with the given ID, altering the given hash of counters by the amount
        # given by the corresponding value:
        #
        # ==== Attributes
        #
        # * +id+ - The id of the object you wish to update a counter on.
        # * +counters+ - An Array of Hashes containing the names of the fields
        #   to update as keys and the amount to update the field by as values.
        #
        # ==== Examples
        #
        #   # For the Post with id of 5, decrement the comment_count by 1, and
        #   # increment the action_count by 1
        #   Post.update_counters 5, :comment_count => -1, :action_count => 1
        #   # Executes the following SQL:
        #   # UPDATE posts
        #   #    SET comment_count = comment_count - 1,
        #   #        action_count = action_count + 1
        #   #  WHERE id = 5
        def update_counters(id, counters)
          updates = counters.inject([]) { |list, (counter_name, increment)|
            sign = increment < 0 ? "-" : "+"
            list << "#{connection.quote_column_name(counter_name)} = #{connection.quote_column_name(counter_name)} #{sign} #{increment.abs}"
          }.join(", ")
          update_all(updates, "#{connection.quote_column_name(primary_key)} = #{quote_value(id)}")
        end
      end
    end
