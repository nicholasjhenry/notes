## Consumer Group Configuration

I recommend using: identifier = "#{group_size}-#{group_member}" You want the identifier to change when the group size changes. Group member 0 of a 1 sized group is not the same as 0 of a 2 sized group. They handle different sets of streams. Without this, you must be careful to clear your position store any time you scale. otherwise, itâ€™s very possible that messages will be skipped, which is disastrous
