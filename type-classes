## Functor (Mapable) / Applicative / Monad

- A *functor* is a data type that implements the Functor typeclass.
- An *applicative* is a data type that implements the Applicative typeclass.
- A *monad* is a data type that implements the Monad typeclass.

A Maybe implements all three, so it is a functor, an applicative, and a monad.

What is the difference between the three?

* functors: you apply a function to a wrapped value using fmap or <$>
* applicatives: you apply a wrapped function to a wrapped value using <*> or liftA
* monads: you apply a function that returns a wrapped value, to a wrapped value using >>= or liftM

Operators:

* map: <$> <!>
* apply: <*>

## Monoid (Combinable - two things at a time)

- "an aggregation pattern"

Examples:

- sum
- product
- composition
- concatenation

Rules:

1. Closure: The result of combining two things is always another one of the things.
   e.g. "reduce"
2. Associativity: When combining more than two things, which pairwise combination you do first doesn’t matter. e.g.
    - Divide and conquer algorithms
    - Parallelization
    - Incrementalism
3. Identity element: There is a special thing called “zero” such that when you combine any thing with “zero” you get the original thing back.

## Semigroup

Obey the two laws above. (i.e. no identity function.)

Examples:

- a domain consisting of positive number (i.e. no "zero" - identity)

## Monoid Homomorphisms

"is a transformation that preserves an essential “monoidness”, even if the “before” and “after” objects are quite different.""

- Given a function that maps from one monoid to another (like 'wordCount' or 'mostFrequentWord')
- Then to be a monoid homomorphism, the function must meet the requirement that:

    function(chunk1) + function(chunk2) MUST EQUAL function(chunk1 + chunk2)

## Working with non-monoids

Design tips:

- To easily create a monoidal type, make sure that each field of the type is also a monoid. (Question to think about: when you do this, what is the “zero” of the new compound type?)
- To enable closure for a non-numeric type, replace single items with lists.
